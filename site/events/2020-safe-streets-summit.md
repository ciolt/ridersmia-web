The Summit is a collaborative effort between the Miami-Dade Transportation Planning Organization, the Broward Metropolitan Planning Organization as well as the Palm Beach Transportation Planning Agency to provide a local yet regionally connected approach to prioritizing and implementing Complete Streets throughout southeast Florida. It brings together national speakers, public officials, technical staff, and community partners to elevate our efforts on how to design and implement safe and equitable transportation facilities for all modes of transportation.

The theme for the 2020 Safe Streets Summit is "Vision 20/20" bringing a focus on building and implementing a collective regional vision for better streets, better communities, and a better life for all residents. This year, the Summit is returning to where it all started, Broward County! It will be held at the Marriott Harbor Beach hotel in Fort Lauderdale. Join us on February 6 for the Pre-Conference Mobile Workshop and on February 7 for a full conference day with terrific speakers and networking opportunities.
